This is my personal site.

## Setup

Bootstrapped with `npm create vite@latest frontend-starter-custom -- --template react-ts`, with some edits from the earliest edition of my [custom frontend starterpack](https://github.com/zhouselena/frontend-starter-vite). 

Uses Vite, SASS, and Typescript.

## Deploy

Deployed from `gh-pages`. Run custom script `npm run deploy-full-run` from repository to update.

## Notes

I've never fully set up a React project myself before so this a werid Frankenstein between my React.js starterpack from CS52 and DALI CRUD template for tsx and vite. There's probably a lot of dependencies installed that aren't necessary and I haven't tried custom domain or deploying from Render yet so things may get messier.
